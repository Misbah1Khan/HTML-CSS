    <h1>Cricket</h1>
    <p><i>Cricket is a widely popular sport played in numerous countries around the world,</i> particularly in countries such
        as India, England, Australia, and Pakistan. It is a bat-and-ball game that involves two teams of eleven players
        each. <b>The game is played on a large oval-shaped field with a rectangular pitch in the center.</b> The objective is
        for the batting team to score as many runs as possible while the fielding team tries to dismiss the batsmen and
        restrict the scoring.</p>
    <p><i>Cricket is known for its unique blend of strategy, skill, and endurance.</i> Matches can last multiple days in the
        Test format, or shorter durations in limited-overs formats like <b>One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 (T20)
        matches.</b> The sport is characterized by a variety of exciting elements, such as powerful batting strokes,
        precision bowling techniques, acrobatic fielding, and intense rivalries between teams.</p>
