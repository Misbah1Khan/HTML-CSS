    <p>Grilled Fish is a delightful and healthy dish that showcases the natural flavors of fish while adding a subtle
        smoky touch. This popular preparation method brings out the best in various types of fish, such as salmon,
        trout, snapper, or sea bass. The fish is typically marinated in a blend of herbs, spices, lemon juice, and olive
        oil, which not only enhances its taste but also helps to keep it moist during grilling. The marinated fish is
        then placed on a hot grill, where it cooks to perfection, creating a beautiful charred exterior and a tender,
        flaky interior. The grilling process infuses the fish with a delicate smoky flavor, adding depth and complexity
        to its taste. Grilled Fish is often served with a side of fresh salad, steamed vegetables, or a squeeze of lemon
        to enhance its natural flavors. This light and flavorful dish is not only delicious but also a great source of
        lean protein and essential nutrients. Whether enjoyed as a main course or as part of a healthy meal, Grilled
        Fish offers a delightful culinary experience that satisfies the taste buds while promoting a balanced and
        nutritious diet.
