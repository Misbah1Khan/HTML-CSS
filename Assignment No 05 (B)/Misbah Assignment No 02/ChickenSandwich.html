        lettuce, tomato slices, onions, pickles, cheese, and sauces like mayonnaise, mustard, or barbecue sauce. These
        ingredients add freshness, crunch, and a burst of flavor to each bite. The Chicken Sandwich can be enjoyed in
        various forms, including the popular choices of a classic chicken club sandwich, a spicy chicken sandwich, or a
        buffalo chicken sandwich. It is a versatile option that caters to different preferences and dietary needs.
        Whether enjoyed as a quick lunch, a picnic favorite, or a satisfying meal on the go, the Chicken Sandwich is a
        timeless classic that continues to be a beloved choice for its convenience and deliciousness.
