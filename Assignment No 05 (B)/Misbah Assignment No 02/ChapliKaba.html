    <p>Chapli Kabab is a mouthwatering and flavorful dish that hails from the Pashtun cuisine of Pakistan and
        Afghanistan. These succulent and aromatic kababs are known for their unique shape and distinctive taste. The
        word "chapli" means flat, and true to its name, these kababs are flattened and round in shape. The main
        ingredient in Chapli Kabab is minced meat, usually beef or lamb, which is mixed with a variety of spices and
        ingredients to create a burst of flavors. The meat is combined with finely chopped onions, tomatoes, green
        chilies, coriander, and a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander powder, red chili powder, and garam masala.
        The mixture is then shaped into patties and shallow-fried until golden brown and cooked to perfection. The
        result is a juicy and tender kabab with a crispy outer layer. Chapli Kabab is often served with naan bread,
        raita (yogurt sauce), and fresh salad, allowing you to savor the combination of textures and tastes. The
        flavorsome spices, combined with the juicy meat and the charred crust, make Chapli Kabab a beloved dish among
        food enthusiasts. Whether enjoyed as an appetizer, a main course, or a street food delicacy, Chapli Kabab offers
        a delightful culinary experience that showcases the vibrant flavors of the region.
