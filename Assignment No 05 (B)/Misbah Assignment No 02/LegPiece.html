        from the leg portion of the chicken. This popular barbecue delight is cherished by chicken lovers for its juicy

        its magic, infusing the chicken with a burst of flavors and ensuring that every bite is packed with
        deliciousness. The marinated leg piece is then grilled to perfection, allowing the flavors to intensify and the
        chicken to develop a delightful charred and smoky exterior. The Chicken Tikka Leg Piece is often served with a
        side of mint chutney, fresh salad, and naan bread, complementing the flavors and providing a satisfying meal.
