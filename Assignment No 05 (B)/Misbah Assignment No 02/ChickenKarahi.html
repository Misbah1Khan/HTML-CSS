    <p>Chicken Karahi is a beloved and flavorful dish that is synonymous with Pakistani and North Indian cuisine. This
        aromatic and spicy delicacy showcases succulent pieces of chicken cooked in a thick, tangy, and slightly spicy
        tomato-based gravy. The chicken is marinated in a blend of yogurt and spices, which adds depth and tenderness to
        the meat. It is then stir-fried with onions, garlic, ginger, and a melange of aromatic spices, including cumin,
        coriander, turmeric, and red chili powder. The result is a dish that boasts tender chicken coated in a rich and
        robust gravy that is bursting with flavors. Chicken Karahi is often garnished with fresh coriander leaves and
        green chilies, adding a refreshing and vibrant touch. This mouthwatering dish is best enjoyed with naan bread or
        steamed rice, allowing you to relish every delightful bite. Chicken Karahi is a true culinary delight that
        satisfies both spice enthusiasts and lovers of bold flavors.
